Hello, I'm Adam. Just your standard swedish asian guy currently attending my last year as a student for M.sc. in Computer Engineering with emphasis on Computer Security at Blekinge Institue of Technology. 

Here you will find a good mixture of everything from cryptography to piano, digitalized forever.

Oh. I also do photography.
