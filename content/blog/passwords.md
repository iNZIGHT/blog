Something that really grinds my gears is people who still recommends super complex passwords. I mean come on, it's 2018 for christs sake.
The old password laws are dead, please just accept that. Just because one pumps a password full with exclamation points, offerings to the devil and half a can of tuna, does not make it a good password.
Super complicated passwords such as !#121dsSDA32jKCS(9"###!"SDd2 are just to much for the simple human mind to handle. Especially when we need to have thirty of them, all different.
Instead, why not use a *longer* password? No need for fancy spinning rims or all flavoured icecream. An excellent comic on this is over at https://xkcd.com/936/. 

Finally, if you want to avoid the hustle of remebering 50 different passwords like me, just use a password manager. This way, you only have to remember one good strong password. Combine this with 2FA hardware token (I use yubikey) and you are good to go.

Yours, 
Adam
